        Install the CUDA Toolkit and drivers:
        Download and install the CUDA Toolkit and drivers from the NVIDIA website.
        This will install the necessary CUDA runtime libraries and tools on your system.

        Set up your development environment: To use CUDA in Java,
        you will need to use a third-party library that provides Java bindings to the CUDA API.
        Some popular options include JCuda and JOCL. Download and install the library of your choice,
        and configure your development environment to use it.

        Write your CUDA kernel in C/C++: CUDA kernels are written in C/C++.
        You will need to write your kernel code in a C/C++ source file, and then compile it into a shared library
        (.so file on Linux, or .dll file on Windows) using the NVIDIA CUDA compiler (nvcc).

        Load and execute your CUDA kernel from Java: Once you have compiled your CUDA kernel into a shared library,
        you can load and execute it from your Java program using the third-party library you chose in step 2.
        You can pass input data to the kernel, and receive output data back from it.

        Measure performance: To test the performance of your GPU, you can measure the execution time of
        your CUDA kernel using the System.nanoTime() method in Java. You can also experiment with different input
        sizes to see how performance scales with problem size.
